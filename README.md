# Technical Documentation Page

In this project I created a technical documentation page about CSS-transitions.
This is a project from the freeCodeCamp course and it's based on HTML, CSS and javaScript.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/technical-doc-page.git
```

Go inside the **technical-doc-page** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at this app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/technical-doc-page/).


## Main features

* When scrolling the page, in the navigation menu the section title is highlighted accordingly to the section displayed on the screen.
* I used horizontal scrolling container to display the code snippet.
* The app is fully responsive: for small viewport the app become an accordion.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
